# Grade System
This Windows Form Application was presented for the course "Advanced programming" for IAP Cluj-Napoca. It represents an application that centralizes the grades of different students at the Faculty of Letters for different subjects, that can be visualized or modified by different types of users, either student or teacher.
Its main purpose was to apply the OOP concepts and to build a functional application that communicates with a local database. The layout and display of the application can be improved, of course.
